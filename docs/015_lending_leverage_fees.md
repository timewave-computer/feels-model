# Lending & Leverage Fee Model: Dual Risk Mitigation

## Overview

This model addresses the two remaining sides of the risk triangle with dual risk mitigation strategies that balance user and system risks.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Manipulation Resistance**: All metrics are based on:
   - System-wide health indicators (can't be gamed individually)
   - Real risk exposure (requires actual capital at risk)
   - Opportunity costs (can't fake without missing other opportunities)

2. **No Perverse Incentives**: 
   - Doesn't reward users for creating bad outcomes
   - Rewards positive contributions to system health
   - Aligns individual and system interests

3. **Forward-Looking**: 
   - Based on current risk-taking, not historical losses
   - Responds to system needs in real-time
   - Prevents gaming through artificial history

## 1. Lending Side (Credit Risk)

### Risks
- **System Risk**: Insolvency Risk - Protocol may become insolvent from bad debt
- **User Risk**: Bad Debt - Lenders may be exposed to borrower defaults

### Core Metrics

#### For Lenders
- **TVL** (Time-Value Locked): Amount × Duration of locked capital
- **Risk-Adjusted Duration**: Duration × (1 - Average System Health Factor)
- **Liquidity Provision Score**: Availability during high-utilization periods

#### For Borrowers
- **Collateral Quality**: Value and volatility of posted collateral
- **Health Factor**: Collateral value / Borrowed value
- **Liquidation Buffer**: Distance from liquidation threshold

### Lending Fee Formula

$$\text{LendingFee}_i = \lambda_{\text{lending}}(S) \times \frac{\text{TVL}_i \times \text{RiskMultiplier}_i}{\sum_j [\text{TVL}_j \times \text{RiskMultiplier}_j]}$$

Where:
$$\text{RiskMultiplier}_i = (1 + \text{RiskAdjustedDuration}_i) \times (1 + \text{LiquidityProvisionScore}_i)$$

And:
- $\lambda_{\text{lending}}(S) = \lambda_{\text{base}} \times (1 + \beta \times \text{InsolvencyStress}(S))$
- $\text{InsolvencyStress}(S) = \max(0, \frac{\text{TargetSolvency} - \text{CurrentSolvency}}{\text{TargetSolvency}})$

### Why These Metrics Are Manipulation-Resistant

1. **Risk-Adjusted Duration**: Based on system-wide health, not individual outcomes
   - Can't be gamed by creating bad debt
   - Rewards lending during risky periods when system needs it most

2. **Liquidity Provision Score**: Measures availability, not losses
   - Tracks if funds were available when utilization was high
   - Can't be manipulated without opportunity cost

3. **No Historical Loss Tracking**: Avoids perverse incentives
   - Doesn't reward lenders for experiencing defaults
   - Prevents intentional bad debt creation

### Interest Rate Model

Dynamic interest rates that respond to both risks:

$$\text{InterestRate} = \text{BaseRate} \times (1 + \text{UtilizationMultiplier}) \times (1 + \text{SolvencyMultiplier})$$

Where:
- $\text{UtilizationMultiplier}$ = Standard utilization curve
- $\text{SolvencyMultiplier}$ = Increases rates when solvency decreases

## 2. Leverage Side (Price Risk)

### Risks
- **System Risk**: Debasement Risk - System token may lose value from overleveraging
- **User Risk**: Nominal Loss - Leveraged users face amplified losses

### Core Metrics

#### For Leveraged Positions
- **Exposure**: Position size × Leverage ratio
- **Liquidation Distance**: Distance to liquidation price
- **Volatility Absorption**: Realized volatility × Exposure

#### System Metrics
- **Total Leverage Ratio**: Total leveraged exposure / Total collateral
- **Liquidation Cascade Risk**: Concentration of liquidation prices
- **Token Velocity**: Trading volume / Token supply

### Leverage Fee Formula

$$\text{LeverageFee}_i = \lambda_{\text{leverage}}(S) \times \frac{\text{RiskAbsorption}_i}{\sum_j \text{RiskAbsorption}_j}$$

Where:
- $\lambda_{\text{leverage}}(S) = \lambda_{\text{base}} \times (1 + \gamma \times \text{DebasementStress}(S))$
- $\text{DebasementStress}(S) = \text{TotalLeverageRatio} \times \text{VolatilityIndex} \times \text{VelocityMultiplier}$

### Liquidation Protection

Progressive fees that increase as positions approach liquidation:

$$\text{ProtectionFee} = \text{BaseFee} \times \exp(-k \times \text{LiquidationDistance})$$

## 3. Unified Risk Management

### Cross-Risk Interactions

The three risks interact and amplify each other:

1. **Liquidity → Credit**: Low liquidity makes liquidations harder, increasing bad debt
2. **Credit → Price**: Bad debt forces token minting, causing debasement
3. **Price → Liquidity**: Token debasement reduces LP incentives

### Systemic Risk Score

$$\text{SystemicRisk} = \alpha_1 \times \text{LiquidityStress} + \alpha_2 \times \text{InsolvencyStress} + \alpha_3 \times \text{DebasementStress} + \alpha_4 \times \text{CrossRiskAmplification}$$

Where:
- $\text{CrossRiskAmplification} = (\text{LiquidityStress} \times \text{InsolvencyStress}) + (\text{InsolvencyStress} \times \text{DebasementStress}) + (\text{DebasementStress} \times \text{LiquidityStress})$

### Global Fee Distribution

Total protocol fees are distributed across risk types based on stress levels:

$$\text{LiquidityShare} = \frac{\text{LiquidityStress}^2}{\text{LiquidityStress}^2 + \text{InsolvencyStress}^2 + \text{DebasementStress}^2}$$

$$\text{LendingShare} = \frac{\text{InsolvencyStress}^2}{\text{LiquidityStress}^2 + \text{InsolvencyStress}^2 + \text{DebasementStress}^2}$$

$$\text{LeverageShare} = \frac{\text{DebasementStress}^2}{\text{LiquidityStress}^2 + \text{InsolvencyStress}^2 + \text{DebasementStress}^2}$$

## 4. Detailed Metric Calculations

### Lending Metrics

#### Risk-Adjusted Duration
$$\text{RiskAdjustedDuration}_i = \text{Duration}_i \times (1 - \text{AvgHealthFactor}_{\text{system}})$$
- When system health is low (many risky loans), duration is valued higher
- Rewards lenders who lock capital when system needs stability

#### Liquidity Provision Score
$$\text{LiquidityProvisionScore}_i = \frac{1}{\text{Duration}_i} \int (\text{Available}_i(t) \times \text{UtilizationStress}(t)) dt$$
- Integrates availability weighted by system stress over time
- Higher score for being available when utilization is high

### Leverage Metrics Enhancement

Similarly, for leverage positions, we can improve the volatility absorption metric:

#### Realized Risk Absorption
$$\text{RiskAbsorption}_i = \text{Exposure}_i \times \sigma_{\text{realized}} \times \frac{1}{\text{HealthFactor}_i}$$
- Based on actual market volatility absorbed
- Weighted by inverse health factor (riskier positions absorb more)
- Can't be gamed without taking real market risk

## 5. Implementation Considerations

### Feedback Loops

1. **Lending Feedback**:
   - High insolvency stress → Higher interest rates → More lender compensation
   - More lending → Better solvency → Lower stress

2. **Leverage Feedback**:
   - High debasement stress → Higher leverage fees → Reduced overleveraging
   - Less leverage → Lower debasement risk → Sustainable growth

### Risk Boundaries

- **Maximum Leverage Ratio**: Dynamically adjusted based on system health
- **Minimum Solvency Ratio**: Protocol maintains reserves above critical threshold
- **Liquidation Buffers**: Increased during high stress periods

### User Incentives

- **Good Borrowers**: Lower rates through utilization history
- **Conservative Leverage**: Fee discounts for lower leverage ratios
- **Long-term Lenders**: Bonus compensation for extended locks during stress

## 6. Benefits

### For Users
- **Predictable Costs**: Fees reflect actual risks taken
- **Fair Compensation**: Rewards scale with contribution and risk absorption
- **Protection**: System actively manages risks before crises
- **No Perverse Incentives**: Can't game the system by creating artificial risks

### For System
- **Self-Stabilizing**: Automatic responses to emerging risks
- **Capital Efficient**: Directs resources where most needed
- **Robust**: Multiple defensive layers against cascading failures
- **Manipulation Resistant**: Metrics based on system-wide health and real risk-taking

## Conclusion

This dual risk model for lending and leverage completes the triangular risk framework. Each side now has mechanisms that:

1. Compensate users for their specific risks
2. Protect the system from its corresponding systemic risk
3. Create feedback loops that maintain equilibrium

The unified model ensures that all three types of risk are managed holistically, preventing cascading failures while fairly compensating participants for the risks they absorb.
