# Market Participants (Agents)

This document outlines the motivations and interests of various market participants interacting with the Feels Protocol.

## Agent Types

### 1. Issuers
*   **Motivation**: Maximizing coin price appreciation over a long time horizon.
*   **Interests**: Long-term guarantees about increasing price, downside protection is a nice feature but less critical because they have the lowest cost basis.
*   **Behavior**: Primarily long-term holders, focused on the fundamental growth and adoption of the coin.

### 2. Hodlers
*   **Motivation**: Seeing the coin price increase over a medium time horizon.
*   **Interests**: Long-term price increases and downside protection.
*   **Behavior**: Tend to hold assets for extended periods, but are more sensitive to market downturns than Issuers.

### 3. Snipers
*   **Motivation**: Profiting from well-understood, short-term upward price movements.
*   **Interests**: Exploiting predictable price surges, such as those immediately following a launch or a major announcement.
*   **Behavior**: Buy significant supply at the onset of an upward move and sell quickly thereafter. They often use automation to gain a latency edge. A role they play is to quickly capitalize the market and kickstart initial volatility.

### 4. Momentum Traders
*   **Motivation**: Capitalizing on short-term (mostly upward) price swings.
*   **Interests**: Magnifying gains through the use of leverage.
*   **Behavior**: Enter and exit positions rapidly, focusing on short-term trends and using leverage to amplify returns.

### 5. Vol Harvesters
*   **Motivation**: Profiting from market volatility.
*   **Interests**: Benefiting from price fluctuations, ideally while maintaining a delta-neutral position (not betting on price direction of FeelsSOL). If providing JitoSOL as collateral, they expect a yield exceeding that of SOL â†’ JitoSOL.
*   **Behavior**: Employ strategies that profit from price movements regardless of direction.
