# Lending & Leverage Fee Model: Dual Risk Mitigation

## Overview

This model addresses the two remaining sides of the risk triangle with dual risk mitigation strategies that balance user and system risks.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Manipulation Resistance**: All metrics are based on:
   - System-wide health indicators (can't be gamed individually)
   - Real risk exposure (requires actual capital at risk)
   - Opportunity costs (can't fake without missing other opportunities)

2. **No Perverse Incentives**: 
   - Doesn't reward users for creating bad outcomes
   - Rewards positive contributions to system health
   - Aligns individual and system interests

3. **Forward-Looking**: 
   - Based on current risk-taking, not historical losses
   - Responds to system needs in real-time
   - Prevents gaming through artificial history

## 1. Lending Side (Credit Risk)

### Risks
- **System Risk**: **Insolvency Risk** - Protocol may become insolvent from bad debt
- **User Risk**: **Bad Debt** - Lenders may be exposed to borrower defaults

### Core Metrics

#### For Lenders
- **TVL** (Time-Value Locked): Amount × Duration of locked capital
- **Risk-Adjusted Duration**: Duration × (1 - Average System Health Factor)
- **Liquidity Provision Score**: Availability during high-utilization periods

#### For Borrowers
- **Collateral Quality**: Value and volatility of posted collateral
- **Health Factor**: Collateral value / Borrowed value
- **Liquidation Buffer**: Distance from liquidation threshold

### Lending Fee Formula

```
LendingFee_i = λ_lending(S) × [TVL_i × RiskMultiplier_i] / Σ[TVL_j × RiskMultiplier_j]
```

Where:
```
RiskMultiplier_i = (1 + RiskAdjustedDuration_i) × (1 + LiquidityProvisionScore_i)
```

And:
- `λ_lending(S) = λ_base × (1 + β × InsolvencyStress(S))`
- `InsolvencyStress(S) = max(0, (TargetSolvency - CurrentSolvency) / TargetSolvency)`

### Why These Metrics Are Manipulation-Resistant

1. **Risk-Adjusted Duration**: Based on system-wide health, not individual outcomes
   - Can't be gamed by creating bad debt
   - Rewards lending during risky periods when system needs it most

2. **Liquidity Provision Score**: Measures availability, not losses
   - Tracks if funds were available when utilization was high
   - Can't be manipulated without opportunity cost

3. **No Historical Loss Tracking**: Avoids perverse incentives
   - Doesn't reward lenders for experiencing defaults
   - Prevents intentional bad debt creation

### Interest Rate Model

Dynamic interest rates that respond to both risks:

```
InterestRate = BaseRate × (1 + UtilizationMultiplier) × (1 + SolvencyMultiplier)
```

Where:
- `UtilizationMultiplier` = Standard utilization curve
- `SolvencyMultiplier` = Increases rates when solvency decreases

## 2. Leverage Side (Price Risk)

### Risks
- **System Risk**: **Debasement Risk** - System token may lose value from overleveraging
- **User Risk**: **Nominal Loss** - Leveraged users face amplified losses

### Core Metrics

#### For Leveraged Positions
- **Exposure**: Position size × Leverage ratio
- **Liquidation Distance**: Distance to liquidation price
- **Volatility Absorption**: Realized volatility × Exposure

#### System Metrics
- **Total Leverage Ratio**: Total leveraged exposure / Total collateral
- **Liquidation Cascade Risk**: Concentration of liquidation prices
- **Token Velocity**: Trading volume / Token supply

### Leverage Fee Formula

```
LeverageFee_i = λ_leverage(S) × RiskAbsorption_i / Σ(RiskAbsorption_j)
```

Where:
- `λ_leverage(S) = λ_base × (1 + γ × DebasementStress(S))`
- `DebasementStress(S) = TotalLeverageRatio × VolatilityIndex × VelocityMultiplier`

### Liquidation Protection

Progressive fees that increase as positions approach liquidation:

```
ProtectionFee = BaseFee × exp(-k × LiquidationDistance)
```

## 3. Unified Risk Management

### Cross-Risk Interactions

The three risks interact and amplify each other:

1. **Liquidity → Credit**: Low liquidity makes liquidations harder, increasing bad debt
2. **Credit → Price**: Bad debt forces token minting, causing debasement
3. **Price → Liquidity**: Token debasement reduces LP incentives

### Systemic Risk Score

```
SystemicRisk = α₁ × LiquidityStress + α₂ × InsolvencyStress + α₃ × DebasementStress + α₄ × CrossRiskAmplification
```

Where:
- `CrossRiskAmplification = (LiquidityStress × InsolvencyStress) + (InsolvencyStress × DebasementStress) + (DebasementStress × LiquidityStress)`

### Global Fee Distribution

Total protocol fees are distributed across risk types based on stress levels:

```
LiquidityShare = LiquidityStress² / (LiquidityStress² + InsolvencyStress² + DebasementStress²)
LendingShare = InsolvencyStress² / (LiquidityStress² + InsolvencyStress² + DebasementStress²)
LeverageShare = DebasementStress² / (LiquidityStress² + InsolvencyStress² + DebasementStress²)
```

## 4. Detailed Metric Calculations

### Lending Metrics

#### Risk-Adjusted Duration
```
RiskAdjustedDuration_i = Duration_i × (1 - AvgHealthFactor_system)
```
- When system health is low (many risky loans), duration is valued higher
- Rewards lenders who lock capital when system needs stability

#### Liquidity Provision Score
```
LiquidityProvisionScore_i = ∫(Available_i(t) × UtilizationStress(t)) dt / Duration_i
```
- Integrates availability weighted by system stress over time
- Higher score for being available when utilization is high

### Leverage Metrics Enhancement

Similarly, for leverage positions, we can improve the volatility absorption metric:

#### Realized Risk Absorption
```
RiskAbsorption_i = Exposure_i × σ_realized × (1 / HealthFactor_i)
```
- Based on actual market volatility absorbed
- Weighted by inverse health factor (riskier positions absorb more)
- Can't be gamed without taking real market risk

## 5. Implementation Considerations

### Feedback Loops

1. **Lending Feedback**:
   - High insolvency stress → Higher interest rates → More lender compensation
   - More lending → Better solvency → Lower stress

2. **Leverage Feedback**:
   - High debasement stress → Higher leverage fees → Reduced overleveraging
   - Less leverage → Lower debasement risk → Sustainable growth

### Risk Boundaries

- **Maximum Leverage Ratio**: Dynamically adjusted based on system health
- **Minimum Solvency Ratio**: Protocol maintains reserves above critical threshold
- **Liquidation Buffers**: Increased during high stress periods

### User Incentives

- **Good Borrowers**: Lower rates through utilization history
- **Conservative Leverage**: Fee discounts for lower leverage ratios
- **Long-term Lenders**: Bonus compensation for extended locks during stress

## 6. Benefits

### For Users
- **Predictable Costs**: Fees reflect actual risks taken
- **Fair Compensation**: Rewards scale with contribution and risk absorption
- **Protection**: System actively manages risks before crises
- **No Perverse Incentives**: Can't game the system by creating artificial risks

### For System
- **Self-Stabilizing**: Automatic responses to emerging risks
- **Capital Efficient**: Directs resources where most needed
- **Robust**: Multiple defensive layers against cascading failures
- **Manipulation Resistant**: Metrics based on system-wide health and real risk-taking

## Conclusion

This dual risk model for lending and leverage completes the triangular risk framework. Each side now has mechanisms that:

1. **Compensate users** for their specific risks
2. **Protect the system** from its corresponding systemic risk
3. **Create feedback loops** that maintain equilibrium

The unified model ensures that all three types of risk are managed holistically, preventing cascading failures while fairly compensating participants for the risks they absorb.
