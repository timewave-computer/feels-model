## LP Fee Compensation Formula: Dual Risk Mitigation

This formula addresses both **user risk** (Loss vs Rebalancing) and **system risk** (Liquidity Crisis) through a unified compensation mechanism.

Let:

* $\text{LVR}_i$: Cumulative Loss vs Rebalancing for LP $i$
* $\text{VWBD}_i$: Volume-Weighted Book Depth contribution of LP $i$
* $\lambda(S)$: Dynamic fee budget function based on system state $S$
* $\epsilon > 0$: A small constant to prevent division by zero

### Core Formula

$$
\text{Fee}_i = \lambda(S) \cdot \frac{ \frac{\text{VWBD}_i}{\text{LVR}_i + \epsilon} }{ \sum_j \frac{\text{VWBD}_j}{\text{LVR}_j + \epsilon} }
$$

### Dynamic Fee Budget Function

$$
\lambda(S) = \lambda_{base} \cdot \left(1 + \alpha \cdot \text{LiquidityStress}(S)\right)
$$

Where:
* $\lambda_{base}$: Base fee budget per period
* $\alpha$: Sensitivity parameter for liquidity stress response
* $\text{LiquidityStress}(S) \in [0,1]$: Measures proximity to liquidity crisis

## üîç Interpretation: Dual Risk Mitigation

### User Risk Mitigation (Loss vs Rebalancing)
* **LPs with high LVR** receive proportionally more compensation to offset adverse selection losses
* Creates sustainable economics for liquidity provision even during volatile periods
* Ensures LPs are compensated for the "cost of doing business" in AMMs

### System Risk Mitigation (Liquidity Crisis)
* **LPs with high VWBD** are rewarded for providing deep, useful liquidity
* **Dynamic fee scaling** increases total rewards when system approaches liquidity crisis
* Prevents liquidity death spirals by incentivizing provision when most needed

### Combined Effect
* The ratio $\text{VWBD}_i/\text{LVR}_i$ creates a balanced incentive:
  - Rewards useful liquidity (numerator)
  - Adjusts for individual LP costs (denominator)
  - Scales with system needs (dynamic Œª)

## Implementation Enhancements

### 1. **Liquidity Stress Metrics**

Define system health indicators for $\text{LiquidityStress}(S)$:

$$
\text{LiquidityStress}(S) = \max\left(\frac{\text{TargetDepth} - \text{CurrentDepth}}{\text{TargetDepth}}, 0\right) \cdot \beta + \text{VolatilityMultiplier} \cdot (1-\beta)
$$

Where:
* $\text{TargetDepth}$: Desired liquidity depth for healthy markets
* $\text{CurrentDepth}$: Actual available liquidity
* $\text{VolatilityMultiplier}$: Scales with market volatility
* $\beta \in [0,1]$: Weight between depth and volatility factors

### 2. **Time-Weighted Normalization**

Normalize both metrics over a shared time window $T$ to ensure fairness:

$$
\overline{\text{VWBD}}_i = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \text{VWBD}_i(t) dt, \quad 
\overline{\text{LVR}}_i = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \text{LVR}_i(t) dt
$$

### 3. **Adaptive Bounds**

Implement dynamic bounds that respond to system state:

* **Minimum VWBD threshold**: Increases during liquidity stress
* **Maximum fee multiplier**: Caps extreme rewards to maintain sustainability
* **LVR compensation ceiling**: Prevents runaway costs during extreme volatility

## Design Philosophy: Self-Balancing Risk Management

This creates a **self-balancing ecosystem** that addresses the fundamental risks in AMM liquidity provision:

### Risk-Aware Design
* **User Risk Management**: Compensates LPs for unavoidable adverse selection (LVR)
* **System Risk Management**: Dynamically incentivizes liquidity during stress periods
* **Dual Optimization**: Balances individual LP sustainability with system stability

### Feedback Mechanisms
1. **Liquidity Crisis Prevention**:
   - System stress ‚Üí Higher Œª(S) ‚Üí Increased rewards ‚Üí More LP participation
   - Creates counter-cyclical incentives that prevent death spirals

2. **Sustainable LP Economics**:
   - High volatility ‚Üí Higher LVR ‚Üí More compensation ‚Üí Sustained participation
   - Ensures LPs remain profitable even during adverse conditions

3. **Efficient Capital Allocation**:
   - Abundant liquidity ‚Üí Lower rewards ‚Üí Capital seeks better opportunities
   - Scarce liquidity ‚Üí Higher rewards ‚Üí Capital flows in

### Manipulation Resistance
* **VWBD** requires sustained useful liquidity provision (hard to fake)
* **LVR** is determined by market conditions and arbitrage (cannot be gamed)
* **Dynamic scaling** responds to actual system needs, not individual actions

This model transforms passive liquidity provision into an adaptive, responsive system that maintains equilibrium between LP profitability and protocol health.
