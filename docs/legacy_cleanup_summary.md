# Legacy Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the legacy code cleanup performed on the Feels Protocol codebase to align with the new vertical ticks architecture.

## Removed Legacy Concepts
- **Bands/Tiers**: Removed all band-based pricing tiers
- **Leverage**: Removed leverage multiplier system in favor of two-tranche system (Senior/Junior)
- **Utilization Rate**: Removed from POL metrics
- **Price Strategies**: Removed complex pricing strategies

## Files Deleted
The following unused files were removed from the codebase:

### Core Modules
1. **src/Clock.purs** - Event-driven protocol sequencing (replaced by new architecture)
2. **src/Execution.purs** - Direct loan matching execution (deprecated, use pool-based system)
3. **src/PositionBook.purs** - Separate position tracking (integrated into main system)
4. **src/PositionFees.purs** - Fee calculations (integrated elsewhere)
5. **src/Risk.purs** - Risk assessment module (functionality integrated)
6. **src/UI/PositionCreator.purs** - Standalone position creator UI (integrated into main UI)

### Test Files
1. **test/PositionTest.js** - Unused foreign function export

## Code Changes

### Core Modules
- **State.purs**: Removed `getUtilizationRate` import and `utilizationRate` field
- **API.purs**: Removed `utilizationRate` from `POLMetricsResult`
- **Incentives.purs**: Simplified to minimal compatibility layer
- **Execution.purs**: Converted to error-only placeholder before deletion
- **LendingRecord.purs**: Kept as compatibility shim only

### UI Modules
- **UI/State.purs**: 
  - Removed `leverage` field from UIState
  - Removed `SetLeverage` action
  - Added `juniorTranchePreference` for simulation config
- **UI/Actions.purs**: 
  - Removed `SetLeverage` handler
  - Simplified position creation logic
- **UI/Components.purs**: 
  - Removed `renderLeverageOptions` function
  - Added legacy handling for `LeverageTerms` display

### Simulation Modules
- **Simulation/Agents.purs**: Updated comment from "high-leverage" to "high-risk, active trading"
- **Simulation/Market.purs**: Renamed `leveragePreference` to `juniorTranchePreference`
- **test/Simulation.purs**: Updated to use new field name

### Test Cleanup
- **test/Model.purs**: Removed unused `Risk` import

## New Architecture
The codebase now fully implements the vertical ticks architecture with:
- Pool-centric design
- Two-tranche system (Senior 1x, Junior 3x exposure)
- Synchronized term expiries (Spot, Hourly, Daily, Weekly)
- Simplified position creation through pools
- No legacy leverage or band concepts

## Build Status
âœ… Project builds successfully with no errors after cleanup.
